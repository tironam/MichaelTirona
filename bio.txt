My name's Michael Tirona! I work at Apple in retail, where I've been since October last year. 
I only do sales, though, so peep the apple support website if your phone's not working, I can't help you there. 
My hobbies include drawing, playing video games, watching movies, and reading (both actual reading and audio books because I drive far for work). 
I have a degree in TV/Film, but I'd really love to learn to code and do web development, hence why I'm here. 
I'm here to change my career and get a job as a web developer and down the line learn some other coding languages, too.
